Use Expo's `expo-store-review` package:
```bash
npx expo install expo-store-review
```

### **Sample Code:**
```javascript
import * as StoreReview from 'expo-store-review';

// After 3rd calculation:
if (calculationCount === 3 && await StoreReview.isAvailableAsync()) {
  StoreReview.requestReview();
}
```
